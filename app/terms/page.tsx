              <h2 className="font-semibold">Arbitration</h2>
              <p>
                In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or
                concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or
                otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved
                only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single
                neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration
                service selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's
                award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the
                event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these
                Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable
                attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms and
                Conditions or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or
                indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties agree
                that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The
                entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be
                determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms

              <h2 className="font-semibold">Class Action Waiver</h2>
              <p>
                Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an individual basis; class
                arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE
                THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S
                INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
                PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH
                AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE
                OTHER. Further, unless both you and COURSEBITE agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
                consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
                representative or class proceeding.
